            I am a future computer engineer with over five years of experience as 
            an electronic technician in the automated industry and later as a customer 
            and service manager of luxury and aquatic leisure. 
            I am a proactive and enthusiast person, always willing to learn and 
            solve any kind of problem. I have strong communication skills, the ability 
            to plan and manage schedules and equipment, leadership abilities, cohesion 
            and teamwork experience and adaptability. I'm also a self-taught learner and 
            have a passion for digital art, which I enjoy in my free time through photography 
            and amateur video creation. Currently, I am improving my programming skills 
            and learning languages such as C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, SQL...
